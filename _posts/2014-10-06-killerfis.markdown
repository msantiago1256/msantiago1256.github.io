##I love this thing.



The truth is i'm still learning but why isn't it a good thing to screw things up and know that everything is going to be ok in the end? Kill it motha, kill it. it's just so freaking cool that all i want to do is type and type and type. i wish i had on e fo tese in the office. i should get one of these keyboards.... i used to make way fewer mistakes i'm not typing as much anymore.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
